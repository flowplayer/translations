If your language is not available and you'd like to contribute a translation, clone the [English translation set](https://github.com/flowplayer/translations/blob/master/languages/en.js), rename it with the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language, change the language code `var` in line 4 and the export definition in the last line, edit the translated elements (everything in `parenthesis`) and create a pull request.
